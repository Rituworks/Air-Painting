# 🎨 Air Painting

Air Painting is an interactive computer vision project that lets you **draw in the air using just your fingers** ✋ — no physical brush or touchscreen required.
It uses **OpenCV** for video capture and rendering, and **MediaPipe** for real-time hand tracking.

* ✨ **Adaptive Brush Thickness** – Stroke width changes based on drawing speed.
* 📷 **Real-time FPS Counter** – Monitor performance while drawing.
